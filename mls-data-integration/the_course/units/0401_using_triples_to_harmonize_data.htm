<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Using Triples to Harmonize Data</strong></p>
<p>Triples can be used to harmonize data coming in from different systems.</p>
<p>For example, for a company name that is different in two different systems (perhaps the company trades under more than one name), a triple could be written to say that they are actually the same company. </p>
<p class="code">&lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Biking_Winery_Tours&gt; <br>
&lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs&gt; <br>
&lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Napa_Biking_Tours&gt; </p>
<p>Or, for an intelligence organization, triples could be used for different names that people have used (i.e. aliases), or even just variations of their name. </p>

<p class="topic-sub-heading">Relationships and Facts</p>
<p>Triples are excellent for  describing   relationships between entities, and can also be used  for facts about entities. </p>
<p>For example, a triple could say that Outback Rides was acquired by Sam Stone.</p>
<p class="code">&lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Outback Rides&gt; <br>
&lt;http://procycling.com/ontology/acquiredBy&gt; <br>
&lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Sam_Stone&gt;</p>
<p>With a few triples similar to the one above, a query could then be written to see if there are other companies that have been acquired by Sam Stone.</p>
<p>Or, a triple could be written to say that a person is on the board of directors for an organization.</p>
<p class="code">&lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Rolling_Fast_Deliveries&gt; <br>  &lt;http://procycling.com/ontology/boardMember&gt; <br>  &lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Michael_Ross&gt;</p>
<p>With a few triples similar to the one above, a query could then be written to see what other companies have Michael Ross as a board member. </p>
<p>Or, a triple can be used to simply specify a fact about an entity.</p>
<p class="code">&lt;http://procycling.com/resource/Outback Rides&gt; <br>
&lt;http://procycling.com/ontology/acquiredIn&gt; <br>
