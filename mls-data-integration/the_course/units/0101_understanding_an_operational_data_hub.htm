<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding an Operational Data Hub</strong></p>
<p>An operational data hub, commonly used to integrate data from <strong>multiple systems</strong> to get a complete view of an entity in real-time (e.g. a customer,  an employee, a patient, a provider, a product, an asset, a person of interest, or any item of interest), provides a way to easily bring data in and out.</p>

<p>For example, imagine, for a customer, having  data for a customer's online and in-store purchases in accounting systems, data about phone, chat, and email support incidences for the  customer in a customer support system, corporate factsheet data about a customer stored a sales system, and loyalty card, contact information, contact preferences, and marketing history for customer contacts in one or more marketing systems. Imagine wanting to bring all of that data together, to have a <strong>360° view</strong> of a customer. </p>
<p>Imagine being able to then view that collated data either through a custom real-time application you or your organization have created, or through a SQL-based application that your company uses. </p>
