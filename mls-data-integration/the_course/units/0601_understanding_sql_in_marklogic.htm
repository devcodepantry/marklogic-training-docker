<p class="topic-heading"><strong>Understanding SQL in MarkLogic</strong></p>
<p>One of the many languages supported in MarkLogic  is SQL. </p>
<p>MarkLogic supports SQL so that data stored in a MarkLogic database can be easily consumed by  technologies that require a SQL data source (e.g. many business intelligence and reporting tools). </p>
<p>Like all of the MarkLogic  interfaces, MarkLogic's SQL interface is able to serve data from MarkLogic in real-time, even if the database is quite large, due to the  sophisticated indexes that are core to MarkLogic. </p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">View Required</p>
<p>Once  a template<strong> view</strong> has been created, SQL queries can be run against the view, to retrieve  row data from the database.</p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">Using SQL</p>
<p>SQL queries can be sent via server-side application code or through ODBC.</p>
<p>MarkLogic interfaces available for executing SQL queries against views include running a SQL query in <strong>Query Console,</strong> from XQuery using the  <strong>xdmp:sql()</strong> function, from JavaScript using the  <strong>xdmp.sql()</strong> function, or through the MarkLogic <strong>ODBC Driver</strong>.</p>
<p>Detail on  using SQL with MarkLogic is available at  docs.marklogic.com/guide/sql. </p>

</p>
<p>In MarkLogic 8 and earlier, range views is how views were created. Template views,  available  with MarkLogic 9 and onwards,  are easier to create, and are faster, utilizing the rows index introduced in MarkLogic 9.</p>
<p class="topic-sub-heading">SQL-92 </p>
<p>In general,  MarkLogic  supports the SQL-92 standard for queries, which includes joins and aggregates. </p>
<p>Detail on MarkLogic's SQL-92 support is at docs.marklogic.com/guide/sql/SQLqueries. </p>
